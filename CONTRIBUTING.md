-   Content writing

✨ **Beginners are highly encouraged to contribute.**

## 🛠 Tech Stack Overview

-   **Frontend:** React
    
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/UI
    
-   **Hosting:** Vercel
    
-   **Database & Auth (Optional):** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
    
-   **ORM:** Prisma
    
-   **Forms:** Web3Forms
    

⚠️ **Important:**  
You do **NOT** need Supabase to run the project locally unless you are working on backend-related features.

## 🚀 Local Setup (Without Supabase)

Most contributors can run the project **without any backend setup**.

### 1\. Fork the Repository

Click the **Fork** button on GitHub to create your own copy.

### 2\. Clone Your Fork

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/Kishan-Campus.git cd Kishan-Campus`

### 3\. Install Dependencies

`npm install`

### 4\. Start the Development Server

`npm run dev`

The app should now be running locally.

✅ You can work on:

-   UI components
    
-   Pages
    
-   Layout
    
-   Styling
    
-   Content  
    without any backend configuration.
    

## 🔌 When Do You Need Supabase?

You only need Supabase if you are working on:

-   Authentication
    
-   Database features
    
-   Admin panels
    
-   Backend logic
    

If you are **not** working on these, you can safely skip Supabase.

1.  Create a free Supabase account
    
2.  Create a new project
    
3.  Copy your project credentials
    
4.  Create a `.env` file:

5.  Restart the development server
